## Technologies Used

| Technology | Role                                              |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| OpenCV     | Video capture and preprocessing                    |
| YOLOv11    | Object detection (face, eyes, head)                |
| TensorFlow | Model training and inference                        |

## System Architecture and Workflow

1. Capture live video feed using OpenCV.  
2. Detect face, eyes, and head position with YOLOv11.  
3. Feed detections into TensorFlow model to classify drowsiness.  
4. Backend (FastAPI) sends alert status to frontend.  
5. React frontend provides visual and audio alerts to driver.

## Model and Training Data

- Dataset consists of driver face and eye images under various conditions.  
- Model trained on blink frequency, eye closure duration, and head tilt.  
- High accuracy and low error rates achieved (see figures below).
